#Calvin Dining Hall App Vision

The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive dining app for Calvin students, faculty and providers. The key benefit to creating this app is that it will make the dining experience at Calvin better for students. The information currently available is scattered and inefficient. Our goal is to encompass functions such as meal count, complete menu, friend locator, scheduler, crowd estimations etc. The app can also be utilized to obtain efficient feedback on food and service through surveys, simple swipe right-or-left questions. There are similar apps in existence, however none are tailored to Calvinâ€™s students, network and academic environment.

Uses:
The app will provide a personalized meal count feature. The menu for the day, times open and comparisons for each dining hall will be shown with health statistics. Dining Hall Employees will also be able to creat Surveys, ratings and feedback forms for students to fill out. An ID based friends nearby feature will also be implemented along with estimated poeple at that area (ex. How full is Commons?).
