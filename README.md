The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive dining app for Calvin students, faculty and providers. The information currently available is scattered and inefficient our goal is to encompass functions such as meal count, complete menu, sitting with friends, scheduler, crowd estimations etc.The app can also be utilized to obtain efficient feedback on food and service through surveys, simple swipe right-or-left questions. The key benefit to creating this app is that it will make the dining experience at Calvin better for students. There are apps in existence such as “Yale Dining”, however an app tailored to Calvin’s students, network and academic environment would be very useful.

Uses: Meal count Menu with health/ calorie info Places to sit Surveys, ratings, feedback (even visual) ID based friends nearby/ random eat with people Estimated people at Area. (ex. How full is Commons?)
